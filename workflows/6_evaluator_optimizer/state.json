  "suggestion": "# Staying Hydrated All Day\n\n- Start with a glass of water first thing in the morning\n- Carry a reusable water bottle everywhere\n- Set reminders on your phone every hour\n- Flavor water with fruit if plain water gets boring\n- Eat hydrating foods (cucumber, watermelon, oranges)\n- Drink a glass of water before each meal\n- Monitor urine color - aim for light yellow",
  "feedback": "This suggestion provides a comprehensive and practical approach to staying hydrated all day long. It covers multiple strategies including: starting the day with water, carrying a water bottle, setting reminders, making water more appealing with fruit, incorporating hydrating foods, drinking water before meals, and using urine color as a physical indicator of hydration status. The suggestion is well-structured in bullet point format making it easy to follow, and includes both direct water consumption methods and complementary approaches (like hydrating foods). It addresses both the \"how\" (practical methods) and subtle reminders/tracking to ensure consistency throughout the day.",
